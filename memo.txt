Why this is needed:

Some 2D material databases store structures with zero or negligible vacuum spacing
CHGNet and pymatgen expect 3D periodic cells with non-degenerate lattice vectors
A c-axis of nearly zero would create a singular (non-invertible) lattice matrix, causing errors
Example:

This is a common preprocessing step for 2D materials to make them compatible with 3D-periodic software tools. The 20 Å spacing prevents interlayer interactions in the periodic image
